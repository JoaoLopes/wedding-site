  "aboutSectionGroomName": "João",
  "aboutSectionGroom": "João was born in 1988 and grew up in the small village of Trouxemil. He studied Computer Science at University of Coimbra. These days, João lives in Dublin, where he works as Software Engineer. When he’s not busy upgrading a database or doing presentations to clients, you’ll often find him diving into DIY projects or tinkering with small electronics. He’s also an avid scuba diver and has been skydiving for over ten years.",
  "aboutSectionBrideName": "Diana",
  "aboutSectionBride": "Diana was born in 1989 and grew up in the small village of São João do Campo. She studied Design and Multimedia at University of Coimbra. These days, Diana lives in Dublin, where she works as a UI Engineer. Outside of work, Diana’s happiest when she’s doing something hands-on or adventurous. She has a soft spot for arts and crafts (you’ll often find her sketching, sewing, or trying a new DIY project), and she’s also a bit of a thrill-seeker—whether she’s diving beneath the waves on a scuba adventure or galloping through a field on horseback. More recently, she’s been growing her own vegetables in a small allotment, where she finds joy in gardening and the simple pleasure of watching things grow.",

If you are taking the train, choose the high speed train or the intercity ones, or it will take a full day to get there in a regional train.",

While it may lack the contemporary attractions of Lisbon and Porto, it’s rich in centuries-old monuments that illustrate every chapter of the history of architecture, and the university and surroundings are listed as a World Heritage Site. You can find more information about the city here:",

Walking to the university through the tradicional and old streets of Coimbra, as its name says in Portuguese 'Quebra costas - Back breaker' might be chalenging (its on the hill side but you should be fine), but you will find a lot of places with good food and good wine or beer! Some places we recomend, if you want to eat tapas is a place called DUX Taberna Urbana. For craft beer, if you cross the river, you will find the Epicura Craft Beer House, where all the beer is good and they also have small tapas if you need something to fill your belly.",
